  -- Creating a Boolean type from scratch - vol. 1 --

  In the first part of the workshop we were looking at an example from the
  language Smalltalk. It showed that a programming language does not need to
  have a built-in concept of a boolean. In Smalltalk both True and False
  were objects that could receive messages.

  Let's try to reimplement this in Java.

  First let's define what a Boolean is. Boolean is a type that has only two
  possible values denoting truth and false (from logic and Boolean algebra).

  data Bool = True | False

  This concise notation gets to the point. A Boolean is either True or False.

  How to describe it in Java?

  A natural thing is to use an enum. A simple Boolean enum might look like:

  // an "Enum" prefix in the name to make it more distinct from the standard
  // Boolean type available in the Java standard library
  enum EnumBoolean {
       TRUE,
       FALSE
  }

  Almost as concise as the Haskell definition but what about the methods like:
  - and
  - or
  - not
  And most importantly what about `if` statements/expressions?

  First let's think about `and`, `or`, `not`. We could add those missing methods
  to the enum, but this would mean using a lot of switch statements e.g.:

  enum EnumBoolean {
       TRUE,
       FALSE;

       public EnumBoolean and(final EnumBoolean other) {
           switch (this) {
               case TRUE: return other;
               case FALSE: return this;
           }
           throw new IllegalStateException("Boolean has more then two cases: " + this);
       }
  }

  Java compiler cannot detect that the switch is exhaustive and we have two
  choices:
  - we will explicitly show each case (like above) and drop the default case
    in favor of an exception thrown at the end
  - we will use a default e.g. treat FALSE case as default, this will spare us
    the need of using an exception.

  Instead of having a switch in each method we can have two implementations, one
  for True and another for False.

  Let's do this instead!

enum EnumBoolean {
    TRUE() {
        /*
          Part 1:

          Consider this TRUE case and implement methods: `and`, `or`, `not`.
         */
        @Override
        public EnumBoolean and(final EnumBoolean other) {
            return other;
        }

        @Override
        public EnumBoolean or(final EnumBoolean other) {
            return this;
        }

        @Override
        public EnumBoolean not() {
            return FALSE;
        }

        /*
          Part 2:

          The Smalltalk objects representing True and False support two distinct
          messages called `ifTrue` and `ifFalse`. These methods can handle what
          would normally be done with

          if (condition) {
              //ifTrue block of code
          } else {
              //ifFalse block of code
          }

          To simulate the block of code that is run in both cases we need a way
          of passing it to the function. We want something that does not take
          an argument and does not return a result.

          There is a type already that meets these expectations, it's as old as
          Java itself. It is called Runnable. Unfortunately it is associated
          with Threads and concurrency thus could spawn unnecessary confusion.

          This is why we can define something similar.

          interface Effect {
              void perform();
          }

          Please add implementation of `ifTrue` and `ifFalse`
         */
        @Override
        public EnumBoolean ifTrue(final Effect effect) {
            effect.perform();
            return this;
        }

        @Override
        public EnumBoolean ifFalse(final Effect effect) {
            return this;
        }

        /*
          Part 3:

          Java treats `if` as statement but it's much more useful as an
          expression. Expression allows us to pass the result from the `if` into
          another variable, this means that it could be final (immutable).

          We can define a `match` method that returns some type A and takes
          two different Suppliers one for TRUE case and second for FALSE.

          Passed suppliers should be called in the correct case.

          Please add implementation of `match` method.
         */
        @Override
        public <A> A match(final Supplier<A> ifTrue,
                           final Supplier<A> ifFalse) {
            return ifTrue.get();
        }
    },
    FALSE() {
        /*
          Part 4:

          Please add implementations of missing methods for the FALSE case.

          Questions:
          - Can we model anything with enum?
          - What are the issues with enum?
          - Can each case take different arguments?
          - Can we instantiate the same case with different arguments?
          - Most importantly what was the point?
